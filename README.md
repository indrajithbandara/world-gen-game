Java game made with slick2d that uses procedural world generation to generate the world.
The world generation code edits the world mostly by simulating turns.

The game is turn based.

Kill all the enemies to win the level, each level get's progressively harder each time.
You have money that can be used to buy things from the shop that will be put into your inventory. There are weopons that you can use on the enemies or landscape, villagers that earn you more money and structures to place.
The world is constantly modified, by the enemies, foliage or by weopons, plants grow etc...
